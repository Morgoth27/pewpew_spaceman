```


## Lore
-------------

Defending expedition space station from space invaders!

Prior to planetary evacuation, space invaders attacked the moon, destorying it and ruining ocean ecosystems, leading to the demise of “Earth”

This is believed to have been a strategic blow by alien forces, and their attempt to eradicate human-kind. “Earth”’s resources and life were previously hanging by a thread due to planet-wide neglect and stripping of natural resources.

Humans seek to find a another planet to inhabit, and have deployed expeditiary space stations.

However, these alien forces, after having learned of mankind’s stubborn resistance to eradication, have returned with the intention of destroying the vulnerable space stations.

It is our mission to preserve and protect not only the space stations, but humankind as we know it.


2070 - Final decline of planet Earth, with little to no hope for return

2075 - Deployment of test station, mission deemed successful and sustainable

2076 - Moon attacked and destroyed by aggressive alien forces

2076 - Within moments, the coastal ecosystems are impacted -- significantly weakened tides are now the norm, as only the sun remains to sway them. Eventually these coastal ecosystems will be rendered extinct.

Within months the waning tidal power impacts the travel of warmer waters all over the globe, and climate is further destabilized.

Within years, Earth begins to over-tilt, exacerbating the weather and temperature fluctuations already taking place due to mass pollution from generations prior. Scientists anticipate another Ice Age.

2077 - Much of human-life has succumbed to the devastation of the planet. However, a few remain and have been deployed into space with the intention of finding a planetary oasis.

All attempts at intergalactic calls of distress have been cut short by the aggressive alien forces responsible for destroying Earth’s moon. Now, they wait and hunt newly deployed space stations with the intention of forcing mankind into extinction.
